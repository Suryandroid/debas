> #### _A Solution for Sinhala IVR_ ####

The Information & Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) in Sri Lanka has come with an idea to put in place an IVR system in Sinhala, so that such a system’s reach is more and it could benefit the masses more, as a mobile phone is quite a common man’s tool, unlike Internet access or anything. To do this limitations exist in Sinhala speech recognition. ICTA has already sought help from a pioneering company in giving platform solutions for mobile service providers Sri Lanaka. Most notably they are the ones who came up with the IVR system for Dialog Telekom, which was a land mark achievement in the Sri Lankan context. But WaveNET has only managed to do IVR systems in English. From one of their recent assignments in India, they have also come across some Tamil Language IVR systems. But in Sinhala we are yet to see one. So what ICTA really needs is to research into some Sinhala Speech Recognition and Sinhala Text-To-Speech capabilities, and come up with a system.
